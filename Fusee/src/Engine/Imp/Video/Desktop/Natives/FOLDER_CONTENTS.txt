This Folder is empty by design. Its only purpose is to enable Visual Studio to show the
"Natives" folder below the .csproj contents.
The DLLs shown in Visual Studio's Solution Explorer below Natives are directly
listed in the respective .csproj file. DLL files listed here are typically located
under [FUSEE root]\ext. 
To edit the list of native DLLs a project depends upen directly edit the .cspoj file!
