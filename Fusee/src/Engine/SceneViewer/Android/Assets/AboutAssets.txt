Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in
this directory (and child directories) and given a Build Action of "AndroidAsset".

In addition to the above functionality FUSEE considers all assets found in "Assets" 
subdirectories of any referenced projects to be "AndroidAssets" as well. They don't
need to be specified as "AndroidAssets" but can remain simple "Content" items.

These files will be deployed with your package and will be accessible using Android's
AssetManager, like this:

public class ReadAsset : Activity
{
	protected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle)
	{
		base.OnCreate (bundle);

		InputStream input = Assets.Open ("my_asset.txt");
	}
}

Additionally, some Android functions will automatically load asset files:

Typeface tf = Typeface.CreateFromAsset (Context.Assets, "fonts/samplefont.ttf");
